# MacMote bindings for MythTV
# These will work with the default keyboard bindings for MythTV... It might be
# nice to configure MythTV so that the keys do different sensible things in
# different modes automatically (e.g. up in menu moves up, but in playback it
# increases the volume) instead, but this works.
#
# The menu button switches modes:

# NAVIGATE:  up
#            ^
# esc <-- enter --> right
#           |
#          down

# PLAYBACK:    vol up
#                 ^
# seek back <-- pause --> seek forward
#                 |
#              vol down

# irexec --name mythtv for testing these rules
# irw for testing remote via lirc
# hexdump -v /dev/usb/hiddev0 for testing remote raw

# Thanks to the delay/repeat we might miss double tapping as lirc thinks the
# button is being held down. In this regard it's a shame that lirc isn't more
# intelligent - the MacMote actually only blasts the button code when it is
# first pressed, then continually blasts a generic repeat code as long as it is
# held down, making it trivial to distinguish between the two, but lirc is
# designed with standard IR remotes in mind so AFAICT it doesn't do that.
# Possibly there is some option I've missed?
